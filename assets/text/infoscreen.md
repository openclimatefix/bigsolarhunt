# Big Solar Hunt Q&A

## :sunny: Why are we hunting for solar panels?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

From almost zero a decade ago, the UK now has over 1 million solar installations. These panels power homes and feed clean energy into the National Grid, reducing the UK's carbon emissions.

Thing is, no one knows exactly where all these solar panels are (and thus, how much solar power is coming into the Grid). Right now, power stations have to keep running in the background as back-up - burning fossil fuels. But, if we knew exactly where these panels all were, the National Grid could predict how much solar power is generated in the UK, and turn down these dirty power stations.

## :computer: Tell me more... how does this work?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

The Open Climate Fix team is teaching a computer how to recognise solar installations from photographs. But in order to teach the computer, you need lots of examples for it to learn from.

Here's the good news: the OpenStreetMap community has already mapped 25% of UK panels! But to create a really powerful computer solar panel hunter, we need to double that. Once we've hit that target, the machines can take over and locate the remaining hard-to-find 50% without anyone lifting a finger.

## :+1: I'm in - how can I help?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

Every time you see a solar panel when you are out and about, take a picture of it (using the orange camera icon at the bottom centre of your screen), and hit upload. It's that simple!
This is the sort of photo we want:

Things to consider:
- Solar panels are generally located on the roofs of houses, so remember to look up!
- Taking pictures of solar panels on somebody's house from the road or pavement is perfectly legal,
but please be considerate of people's privacy when doing this.
- If you do catch someone in your photo, don't worry. All uploaded pictures will automatically blur out faces if they are in the picture.
- If the panels are a little far away from the camera, you can use the zoom function.

## :earth_africa: Is this UK-only?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

Yes, for now. But once we've got this working it can be used to map panels all around the world - providing data to help clean energy push out dirty fossil fuels across the globe.

## :evergreen_tree: How much CO2 does this save?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

This project could save 100,000 tonnes of carbon every year in the UK alone. That's the same amount of carbon 1,653,521 trees would absorb over 10 years! If numbers aren't your thing, you'll have to trust us - that's a lot!

## :camera: What is happening to the pictures?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

The pictures are uploaded to [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/), an open database of street-view pictures.
the pictures will then be processed and the size and orientation of the panels will be captured. 
This data will then be entered into OpenStreetMap, an open database for geographical data. 
If you would like to access the data you simply need to go to OpenStreetMap and run a search for solar panels.

Mapillary stores the pictures, and uses them for automatically detecting map features.
Your pictures will be publically available on the Mapillary platform. However, the photos won't be on OpenStreetMap -
that's just the map data, so that will just have the solar panel's locations and some other details.

## :eyes: Who is behind this app?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

The project is a collaberation between [Possible](https://www.wearepossible.org) and [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.org). Possible is a charity that brings people together to tackle the climate crisis. Open Climate Fix is a non-profit product lab, totally focussed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible.

## :green_apple: Will you be launching an iPhone version of the app?

![line break](resource:assets/images/line_break.png)

We hope to in the near future, we're currently working on it. If you'd like to be notified when we do, please enter your email address [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerGIxcwwTQR1Eqks_pL5hILa6kJRUlRtRbHxjUcgLu5U6F-Q/viewform).
