Because of this the people who run our electric grid need to have backup generators running, to avoid blackouts incase solar generation gets too low. Most these backup generators are powered by fossil fuels. So even if we have lots of solar panels installed, we still need to rely on non-renewable generators.\n\nHowever if we could predict solar generation better we would not have to rely on these backup generators as much. To get better predictions we need data about where solar panels are located. The more data there is the better the predictions will get.\n\nCurrently there is no comprehensive dataset of all the solar panels in the UK. This is why we need your help. Every time a solar panel is added to the dataset the predictions get better and we can rely on the backup generators less.'),
