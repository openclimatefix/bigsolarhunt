# If we wanted, we could automatically create releases with an associated tag
# Then run the build-release-android step only for these tags via
#
# only:
#   refs: ^v\d+.\d+.\d+\+\d+$ 
#
# I haven't put this in because I can't figure out how to automatically populate the tag/
# release description with that of the merge request, and that information is more important 
# for the patch notes on promoting a release than the build number of the release itself
